# hdp_mixture
Hierarchical Dirichlet process mixture model

This is a library that implements a Gibbs sampler for a hierarchical Dirichlet process mixture of normals. It is still in active development, and the API is subject to change. 

hdp_mixture uses source from RANLIB for random number generation and sonLib for basic data structures:
